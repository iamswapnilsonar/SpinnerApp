Usage
-----

How to use:

- Add a "WheelIndicatorView" in the layout editor like you actually do with a button for example

```xml
 <com.dlazaro66.wheelindicatorview.WheelIndicatorView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:id="@+id/wheel_indicator_view"
        app:itemsLineWidth="13dp"
        app:filledPercent="40"
        app:backgroundColor="@color/white"
        />
```
- You can set different attributes just as:

    - Lines size: WheelIndicatorView:itemsLineWidth
    - Inner circle background color: WheelIndicatorView:backgroundColor
    - % of circle filled: WheelIndicatorView:filledPercent


- Also, you can declare it programmatically:
```
 WheelIndicatorView wheelIndicatorView = new WheelIndicatorView(context);
```

- Then add elements to the indicator view, declaring as many WheelIndicatorItem objects as you want:
```
 WheelIndicatorItem bikeActivityIndicatorItem = new WheelIndicatorItem(1.5f , Color.parseColor("#FF5722"));
```
- Every ``` WheelIndicatorItem ``` should have a _weight_ and the chart will draw it as needed, comparing all data set.

- If data set changed, you should call ``` wheelIndicatorView.notifyDataSetChanged() ``` as you would do with an adapter.

- Animate the chart once you added all your elements with ``` wheelIndicatorView.startItemsAnimation() ``` 

- If you don't want your chart to be completed at 100% (for example if you're representing user fitness activity and daily target is only done at 35%) you should call ``` wheelIndicatorView.setFilledPercent(35) ``` 

Add it to your project
----------------------


Add WheelIndicatorView dependency to your build.gradle

```groovy
dependencies{
    compile 'com.dlazaro66.wheelindicatorview:WheelIndicatorView:1.0.0'
}
```
